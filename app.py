    For each month in the given year, find the first Wednesday and the Thursday following it.
    
    Explanation:
    - We loop over each month (from 1 to 12).
    - For each month, we start at the 1st and iterate through the first 7 days.
      This ensures we catch the first occurrence of a Wednesday (weekday() == 2, since Monday is 0).
    - Once the first Wednesday is found, the immediate next day (Wednesday + 1 day) is taken as the Thursday.
    - Each event uses the time slot "08:00â€“12:00" and the title "DONT PARK on the street".
